System administration
This section deals with administrative tasks and system management.
See Core utilities and Category:System administration for more.

Users and groups
A new installation leaves you with only the superuser account,
better known as "root". Logging in as root for prolonged periods of time,
possibly even exposing it via SSH on a server, is insecure.
Instead, you should create and use unprivileged user account(s)
for most tasks, only using the root account for system administration.
See Users and groups.

User management for details.
Users and groups are a mechanism for access control;
administrators may fine-tune group membership and ownership to grant
or deny users and services access to system resources.
Read the Users and groups article for details and potential security risks.

Security
Read Security for recommendations and best practices on hardening
the system.
For a list of applications to allow running commands or starting
an interactive shell as another user (e.g. root),
see List of applications/Security Privilege elevation.

Service management
Arch Linux uses systemd as the init process, which is a system and service
manager for Linux. For maintaining your Arch Linux installation,
it is a good idea to learn the basics about it.
Interaction with systemd is done through the systemctl command.
Read systemd. Basic systemctl usage for more information.

System maintenance
Arch is a rolling release system and has rapid package turnover,
so users have to take some time to do system maintenance.
