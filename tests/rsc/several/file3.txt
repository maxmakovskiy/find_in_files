Be responsible

If an interpersonal issue arises, be open-minded to the possibility that your behaviour or intent, 
actual or perceived, may have contributed to the problem. Arch Linux users are encouraged to cultivate
self awareness and remain peaceable toward their peers. Taking responsibility for our actions is often
a good first step toward a peaceful reconciliation.
